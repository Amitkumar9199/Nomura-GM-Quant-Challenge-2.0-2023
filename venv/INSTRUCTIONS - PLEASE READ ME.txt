1) PYTHON VERSION:

We’ll be using latest python 3.6.7 for this challenge. 
You can download and install python version 3.6.7 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.2/

You may need to add the new Python to your enviroment path. You can do that as explained in below articles:
https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-add-python-to-path-variable-in-windows
https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/


2) INSTALL VIRTUALENV TOOL: 

Run “pip install virtualenv” or "pip3 install virtualenv" in your command prompt
You can also download and install the distribution from https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/

We are using following main packages in our venv: 
shap
matplotlib
plotly
numpy
pandas
statsmodels
scipy
seaborn
xgboost
scikit-learn
pycaret
jupyter
lightgbm
eli5

3) INSTALL AND ACTIVATE “nqc” ENVIRONMENT:

Copy attached file with current zip “requirements.txt” to a folder on your PC
Run below: 

virtualenv nqc --python=python3.6.7

For windows users:

cd nqc
Scripts\activate

For Mac users:

cd nqc 
source bin/activate

* After this, you should see a prefix (nqc) on your command prompt

To Install libraries, run below: 

For windows users:

pip install -r <requirements.txt path on your PC>
eg, pip install -r "C:\nomura_quant_challenge\requirements.txt"

For Mac users:

pip install -r <requirements_mac.txt path on your PC>
eg, pip install -r "C:\nomura_quant_challenge\requirements_mac.txt"

Or the same commands with pip3 instead of pip in case the latter doesn't work

* Please make sure your path is in double quotes as mentioned in example above

YOU'RE ALL SET! 
PLEASE PROCEED TO SCRIPT FOR QUESTIONS USING THE VIRTUAL ENV YOU JUST CREATED! 
COME BACK TO STEP 4 AFTER YOU'RE DONE SCRIPTING AND WANT TO SUBMIT YOUR SOLUTIONS

4) CHECK ENV BEFORE SUBMISSION
****THIS STEP NEED TO BE RUN JUST BEFORE YOUR SOLUTION/RESULT SUBMISSION TO ENSURE THAT YOUR ENVIROMENT IS COMPATIBLE WITH requirements.txt
****THIS STEP DOES NOT NEED TO BE RUN AT THE TIME OF VIRTUAL ENV CREATION (ONLY STEPS 1-3 ABOVE)

Please extract any jupyter notebooks you might have used as .py files in the same folder before this exercise

Before submitting your results, please check your virtual environment as below:
Activate your virtual env “nqc”. To activate, Go to the venv folder(from step 3) and run activate script as mentioned below:

For windows users:

cd nqc
Scripts\activate

For Mac users:

cd nqc 
source bin/activate

pipreqs would have been already installed in your environment, if not, you can install pipreqs by running: “pip install pipreqs”
Run below to generate your current used environment in your code:

pipreqs<SPACE>"<path to the folder where you have coded your solutions/submissions>"<SPACE>--savepath<SPACE>"<path to save current_env.txt>”<SPACE>--encoding<SPACE>utf-8<SPACE>--force

eg, pipreqs "C:\nomura_quant_challenge\code" --savepath "C:\nomura_quant_challenge\current_env.txt" --encoding utf-8 --force

*Please ensure there is no "\" at the end of folder name as its a known issue with pipreqs 

You have successfully generate your current enviroment file, You can review it if it looks okay before validation steps below

Validation steps:

Save attached file “check_current_env.py” (from the instructions zip) and run as follows:   

python<SPACE><path for check_current_env.py script saved above><SPACE>"<requirements.txt path on your PC>"<SPACE>"<path for current_env.txt>"

Eg, python “C:\nomura_quant_challenge\check_current_env.py” "C:\nomura_quant_challenge\requirements.txt" "C:\nomura_quant_challenge\current_env.txt"

If you are facing any issues, please contact nomuragmquantchallenge@gmail.com, 

If you feel that you have used only the libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt but still getting error on step 4, 
please proceed to submit your current environment file in the solutions tab, and we will evaluate
